Problem statement

Atliq Hardware (imaginary company) is one of the leading computer hardware producers in India and well expanded in other countries too. However, the management noticed that they do not get enough insights to make quick and smart data-informed decisions. Hence, company decided to conduct a SQL challenge which will help them to understand the data. Task : Check ad-hoc-requests.pdf - there are 10 ad hoc requests for which the business needs insights. Need to run a SQL query to answer these requests. The target audience of this dashboard is top-level management - hence want to create a presentation to show the insights.
